> 'Knowledge' merely denotes a particular kind of information, which has the capacity to perpetuate itself and stay embodied in physical systems. Natural selection is a process that, by nonpurposefully selecting for biological adaptations, can accidentally create knowledge. It is a non-directed, blind process, which with enough time and generic resources can bring about things that look as if they had been designed. But that is an illusion: no deigner is needed.

It is exactly the same problem that religious explanations for the origin of the universe run into.

In physics, instead, one must explain why one chooses certain particular initial conditions.
