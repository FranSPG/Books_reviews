# The Software Craftsman. Professionalism, Pragmatism, Pride

# Preface

> Making things work is the minimum I expect from someone who is paid for it. When you say that something is finished, it is implied that it works.
> 

> At some point he stopped and started staring at a few lines of code. He spent a few minutes there, occasionally moving the cursor one page up and down again. Back in the 1990s, a developer would be considered a senior developer if she could write code that no one else could understand. “Wow! She must be really good. I have no idea what her code does.” And I made sure to have some cryptic code in there, trying to show how clever I was. At some point he figured out what the code was doing. I was expecting a compliment, at last. “Do you know how disrespectful this is?” he said calmly. “We work on a very large system, with many teams and developers working on the same code base. Can you imagine how hard it would be to understand the code if everyone decided to show off how smart he or she is? Imagine thousands, if not millions, of lines written like that.” And that was a second slap in my face.

# 1. Software Development in the Twenty-First Century

## Seniority

> There is a huge difference between having ten years of experience and having one year of experience repeated ten times.
> 

# 2. Agile

> "Being Agile means adapting successfully to new circumstances."
- Tom Gilb
> 

## Professional Evolution

> Being good at writing code is the minimum skill expected from software professionals. Testing, analysis, ability to understand the business, good communication, and a more extroverted personality became part of the skill set that software professionals need today.
> 

## A Partial Transformation

> The Agile transformations focused mainly on process; empowering people; reducing bureaucracy and waste; priorization; visibility of work in progress; and improving the information flow.
> 

# 3. Software Craftsmanship

## Software Craftsmanship History

> The Pragmatic Programmer: From Journeyman to Master by Andy Hunt and Dave Thomas in 1999.
> 

## Crossing Borders

> Apprenticeship Patterns: Guidance for the Aspiring Software Craftsman, by Dave Hoover
> 

# 4. The Software Craftsmanship Attitude

> If we think that a piece of code we write some time in the past is still good enough today, it means we didn't learn anything since.
> 

## Books, Many Books

> The Pragmatic Programmer, The Mythical Man-Month, Design Patterns (GoF), Test-Driven Development: By Example, 
Extreme Programming Explained: Embrace Change, The Clean Coder, Software Craftsmanship, and Refactoring.
> 

# 5. Heroes, Goodwill, and Professionalism

## Being Professional

> In The Passionate Programmer, Chad Fowler says that saying yes to avoid disappointment is just lying. He even goes further to say that saying yes is an addictive and destructive habit. It’s a bad habit masquerading as a good one.
> 

## Providing Options

> Always saying no is also not a professional attitude. Every no, ideally, should be followed by a list of alternatives. Before saying no, we need to analyze the problem and provide options. Although we may not always be able to come up with viable options, we should at least brainstorm ideas. Sometimes an incomplete idea can help other people to find a different alternative.
> 

> Sometimes there are problems that we simply don’t know how to solve. When this is the case, we should say it as honestly and as quickly as possible. We should also demonstrate we are willing to investigate the problem and give our best shot at solving it, making it clear we are not making any promises besides sharing whatever we learn. Providing updates of our progress as often as we can is our best option; it enables the team to decide what to do with every piece of new information. With new information, the team can contribute with other ideas and also offer help in areas in which they might have a better understanding than we do. This behavior will make the whole team really trust us when we say we know something. Being honest, no matter how bad the situation is, is a sign of professionalism.

# 6. Working Software

## Hostage of Your Own Software

> In order to increase business agility and have a good return on investment, keeping code quality high is paramount.
> 

## A Change in Attitude

> When looking at legacy code, instead of moaning and getting frustrated, we should try to understand it and make it better, constantly applying the Boy Scout rule of making it better than how we found it.
> 

# 7. Technical Practices

## The Right Thing versus the Thing Right

> Bad code is like a cancer, difficult to identify in the beginning, and hard to treat when it is finally discovered. And depending on when it was discovered, life can be prolonged but death is unavoidable.
> 

# 8. The Long Road

## Job as Investment

> The most important thing is to treat every single job as an investment, a step towards a bigger goal.
> 

## Autonomy, Mastery, and Purpose

> In Drive: The Surprising Truth about What Motivates Us, Daniel Pink says that—assuming that money is off the table— knowledge workers are motivated by three things: autonomy, mastery, and purpose.
• Autonomy: It is when we are in control of what we do, how we do it, and when we do it. That should always be the case in a true Agile context.
• Mastery: It is when we are constantly learning and evolving—becoming better professionals and better human beings.
• Purpose: It is when we feel that our job is important and we are contributing to make things better— instead of just doing what we are told without understanding why.

## Career Inside Companies

> And while they focused on the wrong things inside a particular company, our industry was still evolving, making their skills rusty or totally obsolete. All of a sudden, these people—who now have become managers and directors realized they were now stuck in that company, potentially with a high salary but with outdated skills. They pray for the country not to go through another recession; otherwise, what would they do if they lost their jobs? 
On top of that, companies that encourage this type of behavior are left with a bureaucratic and incompetent layer of managers, totally unqualified to understand the intricacies of the job done by the more qualified people below them. This is called “the Peter Principle,” and its effect could be stated as “employees tend to be given more authority until they cannot work competently.” In other words, through political games, misappropriation of credit, hiding incompetence by blaming others, and often unprofessional and dishonest attitudes, some people are promoted to positions for which they are totally incompetent.
People whose skills are obsolete worry about not finding another job where they can keep their salaries and personal life stability. More bluntly, only incompetent people are scared to lose their jobs. Software craftsmen are never scared to lose their jobs. For them, a career inside a company is only viable if it is aligned with their own career aspirations. Software craftsmen know that their careers are long roads, where the journey is far more important than reaching the end of the line.

# 9. Recruitment

> If you think your developers are not good, don’t blame them. First, ask yourself why and how they were hired. Maybe your recruitment process is not working as well as you thought it was. As a company, don’t think you are the only one applying filters and looking for the best people. Good developers are also filtering bad companies out and looking for the best ones.
> 

# 10. Interviewing Software Craftsmen

## A Hiring Company's Perpective

> If a developer doesn’t ask questions about how we work, what we do, what we want to achieve, and what our main problems are, how can we be sure she will be asking questions when she joins the team?
> 

> Here are some of the things we should pay attention to: how enthusiastic and passionate the candidates are when talking about technology, their previous projects and jobs, and their own achievements. How do they describe their failures? Do they take any responsibility for things that went wrong or do they just blame others? Have they done anything to turn an unpleasant situation around? Have they done anything in their previous jobs to improve the things they were complaining about? What sort of environment are the candidates looking for? Can we match their expectations?
> 

# 12. The Cost of Low Morale

## Constrained by Lack of Motivation

> The reason why many companies fail when trying to improve the way they work is low motivation. There is no way we can change an organization when  people are not motivated and don’t care about their jobs. Before trying to convince people to work in a different way, ask yourself: are they motivated to do a good job? Do they really care about improving the way they work? Are they constantly trying to get better at what they do? Do they even believe in or like what the company does?
> 

## Injecting Passion

> “Has anyone learned anything since our last stand-up meeting?” In the first week just another developer and I would answer yes and then describe something we read in a book or blog post, or some technology we tried the night before, or some code we had written. As weeks went by, more and more developers became motivated to learn more and share in our daily stand-ups. We started sharing blog post links, videos, and books.
> 

> What before was a boring department in a large organization was now a cool group of people working very efficiently, always striving to get better.
> 

## Summary

> Low morale can destroy a company. Unmotivated people have no energy to create and bring innovation. They have no motivation to do a good job and take responsibility. But people are not normally like that; they become like that.
> 

# 13. Culture of learning

## Wrong Motiation

> At least we learned a lesson: we will never change an organization by forcing people to adopt a new process or different practices. Instead, we should create a culture of learning, where people can find their own motivation to make things better.
>
